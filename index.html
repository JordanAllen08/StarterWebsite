          <span>Rolling Slow skate Shop is a new apparel, shoe and skateboarding shop that caters to the youth and young adults in the Eau-Claire community. Our focus is to provide apparel, shoes, boards and accessories in an upper scale, industrial chic environment. Our store will exemplify the latest in cutting edge products and trends. We expect to be, and will strive to position ourselves as, the top retail store servicing this particular market.
    
            We are the first and only skateboard shop in the city of Eau-Claire. Our market research within Eau-Claire has indicated that local skaters are frustrated with current retailers in the nearest cities. Our intentions are to obtain 80% market share and become a central hub of shopping activity for the local skateboarding population, as well as for others who would enjoy wearing the latest trends and fashions. Burly will be located at 1234 Skate Rd N, Eau-Claire, Wisconsin. This location places us squarely in the center of the residential and social areas frequented by our target market. We believe that this location is critical to our initial success and long-term growth. We encourage you to come visit our shop and support this new exciting market that is just coming into light. If you have any questions feel free to learn more about Us or Contact Us for local times or product information!</span>
