        <h1>Programmers Report</h1>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>I created a website for my client RollingSlow which is a buisness me and my friend made up.</li>

                <li>I have included a header listing various tags from viewport to browser specifics.</li>

                <li>Each of my pages contains a piece of content. Index acts as a homepage, Products samples some of the things the shop may sell, About is a general overview and a place for the employees to feel like members of the team (employees and all images are royalty free), Contact Us contains made up contact information and addresses, and finally checkout. Checkout was originally supposed to be a shopping cart in which i wrote JS. However upon train and error I made the decision hold off and focus on other elements. </li>

                <li>I have a nav bar with buttons styled with the site in mind. Upon hovering over the buttons it creates a yellow tint.</li>

                <li>Implementation of the mobile screens was a struggle. However I have 2 media quaries running at around 750px and 450px for mobile devices of all shapes and sizes.</li>

                <li>A global style is present through out the webpages. I have used HSL color instead of standard RGB as I like the easy of shade changes!</li>

                <li>All images work well upon loading and have the necessary alt information for those who need it!</li>

                <li>I created a favicon through a website dedicated to it! I left the white background as It was hard to see when clicked off the tab.</li>

                <li>The underlying site map is organises into 2 folders. One for all the images involved. (all images are royalty free or free to use) the other folder is for CSS elements and the style sheet.</li>

                <li>The site is purely CSS, HTML and a sprinkle of failing JS.</li>

                <li>I do get some warning related to my body tags and random other tags. I will be working intell the due date to fix these! However regardless all pages are free of error except the Javascript that doesn't work. Upon friday this will most likely be removed from the project.</li>

                <li>This website is stored in a github repository I have shared with the user twodee. Overall my github was hard to set up but once done its become my new standard even for unity projects.</li>

                <li>Orginally my file names had a capital letter in them. However I recently changed the names in github using a command. So now all files are completely lower case.</li>

                <li>My website is exculsivlly dished out on 8443. While my blog is dished out on 8000.
                </li>

                <li>My website can only be accessed through HTTPS and not HTTP. It been an on going issue to redirect the traffic to the HTTPS site. Currently it gives a 400 bad request. Im working to fix this but for some reason upon messing with it. Apachie will often crash or stop working all together. However if you use the DNS name provided by Duck DNS no issues are present with redirection.</li>

                
                <li>I worked very hard to get my site to look the perfect way in both mobile and desktop formats. It was important that lines where created through out the page & elements.</li>

                <li>RollingSlow currently supports three different font types outside of the logo.
                    the cards that sell products use Arial, h1 use font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace and finally p is equal to font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace.
                </li>

                <li>I currently have a checkout form listed on the checkout page. I also have a relic from my shopping cart experiment waiting to be used! On the form the data is processed which is displayed on the URL at the top of the page.</li>

                <li>EXTERNAL LINKS: external links can be found at the bottom of our page linking to social media platforms!</li>

                <li>My sources code is readable. However next time I would organise my CSS Stlyes page very differently. Currently I have it done by object. The next time I would like to do it by what the content is. Such as all the img related things or text realted things.</li>

                <li>CS268jta.duckdns.org does have a few animations. The animations can be viewed at the top and bottom of the pages!</li>
